This project is about create our own smart chatbot that will learn from users response.
# How to use this project
* First Fork and clone the respiratory to your machine. 
* Then you need to install anaconda promot from [Miniconda website ](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html ) and Choose the vision that suits your device.
 <br> Note: in this project we used python virsion 3.6 so make sure to install it as well.
* After install the miniconda prompt Open it and create new virual environment let's name it "bot" for example.
<br> By using this command we will create the environment .

`conda create --name bot python-3.6 ` 
<br>
* Then install anaconda pip by writing this command. 
<br>

`conda install -c anaconda pip`
* Now we will activate the environment that we just create. <br>
`activate bot`
* After install the prompt and create our new environment we need to install some depentences wich is :<br>
1- tensorflow virsion 1.5 <br>
2- tflearn <br>
3- nltk <br>
<br> Note: go to the file directory that you just clone it by using this command. <br>
<br> `cd the directory path`<br>
Then write this command wich will go to the file Requirements.txt and install the packages that we need. 
<br> `pip install -r Requirements.txt`<br>
* Now that you have the project and installed all the depentences you can run the chatbot by using this command.
<br>Note:make sure you are at the right directory so you can run the script.
